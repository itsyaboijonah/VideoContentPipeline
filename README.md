# VideoContentPipeline
Video Content Pipeline project

This project implements an automatic content creation pipeline for social media post TTS videos, as commonly seen on TikTok.
It is currently configured for scraping, parsing, and generating videos from posts on the popular professional networking app Blind.
Alternate scrapers and parsers can be configured for other sites, such as Reddit or Facebook.
